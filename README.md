## ðŸ“Œ Overview

We propose a novel deep learning architecture that incorporates a multi-attention mechanism to enhance prostate zonal segmentation in pseudo-3D MR images. Our method improves segmentation accuracy across the transition and peripheral zones by effectively capturing inter-slice context and channel-spatial dependencies.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Pseudo-3D multi-slice input strategy for contextual learning
- Hybrid channel-spatial attention modules for enhanced feature representation
- Superior performance on multi-center prostate MRI datasets
- Modular and extensible PyTorch-based implementation
